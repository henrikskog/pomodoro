# Simple Pomodoro

Live product: [Pomodoro.site](https://pomodoro.site)

Nothing more than a Pomodoro timer that runs continuously with intervals set to **25 minutes work** and **5 minutes rest**. 

We wanted to have an easy way to synchronize Pomodoro timers in a team of people. Using this application, anyone can join in at any time and have their break simultaneously as everyone else who is also using the website.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
